Hi for short introduction to know me, I'm Fidel, a final-year international student that have a big fan of branding, marketing, HR, and public relationsâ€”basically, anything that helps people & companies glow up. With my academic journey and practical experiences, I am pretty sure-pretty and sure-that I have my league of my own about word processing, research, analysis situation, and see things through several glasses. I hope we can make a connection for a better future! <3
